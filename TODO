- Rewrite game.js; it is getting pretty messy, especially the code related to 
  moves.
- Have new graphics for the arrows that emphasize it is a territory game, like
  stone walls.
- Authenticate users when they play a move
- Let users choose to be either white or black (or just viewers)
- Auto-leave users if they don't poll for a particular time
