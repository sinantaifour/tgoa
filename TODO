- Rewrite game.js; it is getting pretty messy, especially the code related to 
  moves.
- Have new graphics for the arrows that emphasize it is a territory game, like
  stone walls.
- Authenticate users when they play a move
- Let users choose to be either white or black (or just viewers)
- Auto-leave users if they don't poll for a particular time

Sinan

- General redesign of Javascript (Actively working on it)

- Allow users to leave, and choose where to join



Omar

- Apply the animations to move I do, not only the ones I get from the server (Sinan: Please wait on this one till the new JS is in place.)
- Adding Sounds
- Create a general layout for the website
